# Base
The base setup for most of my projects, including reusable scripts for common activities.

## Branches

### Master

Bleeding edge... Everything happens here first and then tagged into a version at stable points... It could break existing projects that reference it.

### vX.Y.Z

Stable version... Project (for the most part) should reference these. When a version becomes "old", warnings will be added and seen during builds.
